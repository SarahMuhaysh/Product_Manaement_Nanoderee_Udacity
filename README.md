This repository contains all projects conducted as a part of Udacity's Product Management Nanodegree program funded by Misk. The program offers four real case studies belonging to different organizations: Kaiser Permanente, Doordash, Amazon, and LinkedIn. Regardless, this repository depicts the Kaiser Permanente case study, a healthcare provider within the United States (US).

**Case Study Description:** Kaiser Permanente is looking to enter into the preventative care space to help their patient base increase physical activity and improve on healthy habits. While the overall goal is improved patient satisfaction and well being, the specific financial goal is reduced cost by emphasizing improved health prior to any adverse conditions developing. Overall, KP wants to decrease spending on conditions such as type 2 diabetes.
Your team is tasked with researching the potential costs, features and benefits of a mobile application that communicates with KP patients and helps them improve on healthy habits.
